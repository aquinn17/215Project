This is the project for my first large software engineering class project. 
This readme will function as a log book for this project. Everytime I work on this project, we will log that progress or the motivations behind that progress.

Created the Git repositsory for this project.

Discussed a website idea that holds and allows searches for information on all SSW participants and their projects. 

Outline of website:
1) Have a list of people in SSW --> gathered from the Stevens directory --> high priority
2) Have a form that allows people to add their projects. --> high priority
3) Have the ability to search this. --> high priority
4) Forum --> low priority
5) Possibly have authentification --> last thing, low priority

Next steps:
1)
